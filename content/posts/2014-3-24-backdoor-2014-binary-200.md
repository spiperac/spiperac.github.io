This time, we had to deal with an alcoholic.

### Task:
> "Jill was high after consuming \( 2^3 \) glasses of alcohol. In this state, he wrote a C++ program to hide a message, but he doesn't remember it now.  
> Help him recover it. He managed to write a single line of comment."

We received the source code in a file called `obfuscated.cpp`.

### Source Code:

```c

#include<cstdio>
#include<cstdlib>
#define l101(a) rand()%a
#define zlz1 bbb
#define zz mmm
#define zzz mlm
#define bsd gbbrsh
#define xx void
#define backdoor \m/
#define bbb cfc
#define ffff ff
#define ads using
#define un unfortunately
#define fff main
#define gu brnf**k
#define l10l cfc
#define mmm void
#define bbbb cfc
#define vgg long long
#define bub std
#define mlm printf
#define ffffff f
#define lj1 dsnt
#define bmB support
#define cfc int
#define nv guu
#define aa namespace
#define m1m inff
ads aa bub;
xx ffff(), fffff();
mmm ggg();
vgg f = 0x7265616c6c795f69;
zlz1 ccc[] = {0x5a,90,0x5d,89,115,74,68,70,0x5c,79,0x43,87,123,101,110,0x40,0x67};
bbbb fff() {
  l10l ll01 = l101((0x00f1b00>>4)+0x08ff08-354);
  bbbb aaa = 0;
  mlm("%f%l%lld\n"+4, ffffff);
  f++;
  if(ll01<(ll01&-0x1))??<ff ggg="">
}
zz ff(){
  for(bbbb guu=1;guu<18 data-blogger-escaped-guu="">(guu&0x0));++guu) {
    ccc[nv-1] = ((ccc[guu-(((8*(0xd5f650))+1)&1)] ^ (0x31-guu)));
  }
}
zz ggg()??<
  for(l10l cc=0;cc<=0x11;++cc)??<mlm c="" cc="" ccc="" x="">
%>
// oops subtracted by 1 not keeping my base is mind</mlm><!--18--></ff></cstdlib></cstdio>
```		
And we also got a hint: Hint: Preprocess -> Compile -> Execute   
So we, basicly, did what they said. Firstly, we have preproceded file without a compilation. And then compiled, and executed the new preprocessed file (new.cpp).   
	
``` bash
wiremage@oxyz ~/c/b/bin200> g++ -trigraphs -E obfuscated.cpp > new.cpp
wiremage@oxyz ~/c/b/bin200> g++ new.cpp 
wiremage@oxyz ~/c/b/bin200> ./a.out 
8243101811275816809
```

That gave us a nice number, lol.  

Next, we took a peek inside the `new.cpp` source and found an unnecessary `if` statement, so we removed it.  
We discovered that the number we got on the first run came from:  
```cpp
printf("%f%l%lld\n" + 4, f);
```

However, if you look at the next two lines, you'll see calls to functions that also perform some `printf` operations.
So, we decided to force their execution by removing the `if` condition.

``` c

int main() {
  int ll01 = rand()%(0x00f1b00>>4)+0x08ff08-354;
  int aaa = 0;
  printf("%f%l%lld\n"+4, f);
  f++;
  if(ll01<(ll01&-0x1)){ff();ggg();//THIS IF HERE WE REMOVED LOL Remember remove only if part, so ff();ggg(); got executed!
}
void ff(){
  for(int guu=1;guu<18&&(guu>(guu&0x0));++guu) {
    ccc[guu-1] = ((ccc[guu-(((8*(0xd5f650))+1)&1)] ^ (0x31-guu)));
  }
}
void ggg(){
  for(int cc=0;cc<=0x11;++cc){printf("%x%c"+2, ccc<:cc]);
%>
```

After that -> compiled file again -> executed -> got the flag.   

``` bash

wiremage@oxyz ~/c/b/bin200> g++ new.cpp 
wiremage@oxyz ~/c/b/bin200> ./a.out 
8243101811275816809
just_another_FLaG
```
Encode just_another_FLaG with MD5 and thats it, you own the flag.  
  
The flag: **a38834db6eb9d31e3c7e878bae3da748**
