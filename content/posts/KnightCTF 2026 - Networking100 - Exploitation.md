## Task

```
The attacker appears to have identified a web application running on our server. We need to determine what application was being targeted. Find the version and username associated with the application in the capture.

Flag Format: KCTF{version_username}
```

### File ( PCAP)

Download: [pcap2.pcapng](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5Huq9jVrcNGMP-eX2qMgaHoD6bQpV6U/view?usp=sharing)


## Wireshark


#### Finding Username

Lets analyze our pcap file with wireshark by first looking for a username.
We want to check POST methods in login forms by filtering:
```
http.request.method==POST && http.request.uri contains "login.php"
```

Right from the get go we can see that the web app in questions is WordPress, not only by this filter but when we open a file we'll see a lot of WpScan requests.

Since there are only two post requests it was pretty easy to find username:
If we look into first requests data in HTML form which was posted we can see:

```
HTML Form URL Encoded: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Form item: "log" = "kadmin_user"
    Form item: "pwd" = "f750d046"

```

![](/images/60c29f3547f2c82ff48d57daefa8a52a.png)

so the username is: **kadmin_user**

Note:
The second request also contains user, but in form of email adress:
```
HTML Form URL Encoded: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Form item: "log" = "tushar@gmail.com"
        Key: log
        Value: tushar@gmail.com
    Form item: "pwd" = "1234566"
        Key: pwd
        Value: 1234566
    Form item: "rememberme" = "forever"
        Key: rememberme
        Value: forever
    Form item: "wp-submit" = "Log In"
        Key: wp-submit
        Value: Log In
    Form item: "redirect_to" = "http://192.168.1.102/wordpress/"
        Key: redirect_to
        Value: http://192.168.1.102/wordpress/
    Form item: "testcookie" = "1"
        Key: testcookie
        Value: 1
```

This will be a fall back if first one fails, but it looks like a brute-force attempt, since the cookie is wierd and password is 1234566.

#### Finding WordPress version

My approach here was not the best, but i basically dumped all html from pcap file:
```
~/Vault/isec/ctf/knight2k26/net100-exploitation  ✓ $ tshark -r pcap2.pcapng --export-objects http,./dump

```

And then tried bunch of "greps", which very fastly yielded a result:

```
~/Vault/isec/ctf/knight2k26/net100-exploitation  ✓ $ grep -R "generator" dump/wordpress*

dump/wordpress:<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 6.9" />
dump/wordpress(1):<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 6.9" />
dump/wordpress(6):<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 6.9" />
dump/wordpress(7):<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 6.9" />
dump/wordpress(8):<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 6.9" />

```


WordPress version: 6.9


##### Alternative 

The other way i managed to find it is by dumping all tcp streams, iterating trough them and greping "WordPress" string:
```shell-session
~/Vault/isec/ctf/knight2k26/net100-exploitation  ✗1 $ for i in $(tshark -r pcap2.pcapng -T fields -e tcp.stream | sort -n | uniq); do
  tshark -r pcap2.pcapng -q -z follow,tcp,ascii,$i;
done | grep -a "WordPress"

Which also shows

```

## Flag

Flag is: **KCTF{6.9_kadmin_user}**
